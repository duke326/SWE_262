        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe want to help groups of people figure out what to eat quickly and efficiently. Think of the scenario you’ve probably been in a thousand times:
          You’ve just finished a long week of work and are about to meet up with some friends to get some dinner and cool off. You all meet up at a friend's
          place hungry, but nobody knows where to eat. Some people want Korean food, some want American food, and others want Mexican food.
          To try and compromise you all decide to scroll through yelp and suggest places to eat, but alas everyone is just rejecting ideas for one reason or another.
          After an hour has passed, the group still hasn’t decided what to eat and you wish there was a way for your friends to decide what to eat before you get hangry.
          Foodie can help decide somewhere to eat that everyone can be satisfied with.

      <div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-8">
        <p>To solve this problem we would like to create an Android application that would allow people to pick a place
          to eat without the struggle of endlessly scrolling through Yelp to find a spot. We would want our application
          to give individuals a little quiz/questionnaire to get a feel of the kind of food that they want to eat, how
          much money they’re willing to spend, etc.. Afterwards, we would suggest 3-5 options to the group to
          anonymously vote on, in the event of a tie, we would have a re-vote with just the tied options available.
          If people are unyielding and the score keeps tying, the system will randomly pick a restaurant for them.

      <hr>
      <br>
      <div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-8">
        <p>There are several apps existing on the market that try several approaches to address the food selection problem.
          We picked 3 competitors to investigate and compare with our proposal, and three of them target the general
          smartphone users. "Restaurant Roulette" lets users create a roulette where restaurant users select from nearby restaurants.
          Then, users can spin the roulette and the app will randomly pick one restaurant from the roulette as a recommendation for
          the users. This app helps users quickly decide a restaurant destination, but does not give the users the option to define
          preference criteria."Eat Now" provides a wide variety of preference criteria for users to select restaurants. This app first
          uses a location tracker or zip code to locate the user, then provides a list of criteria for the user to define. The criteria
          include the distance from the users, price range, food type, and number of results to show. Then, it creates a list of recommended
          restaurants based on the user's preference criteria. The user can further choose to select all or some from the list. Finally, this
          app implements a spinner system to randomly pick one restaurant for the user. This app helps users to randomly select a restaurant in
          a timely manner. Lastly, "Dining Decider" is a map-based application and has a map showing on the home page. It provides a few
          preference criteria for the user: distance, prices, range, and food type. After selecting preference criteria, users can simply swipe
          down, and it will show the recommended restaurant and its location on the map. This app suits users that have special concerns about
          the location and the traffic to the restaurant.

      <h1>User research and results</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>We conducted research by interviewing people with varying backgrounds to get an idea of the type of people
      that would potentially use Foodie. We wanted to form personas so that we could understand everyone's story and what drives them. This
      helped us design the features for the application. </p>

      <div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-8">
        <p>One of the most apparent things we observed was that almost every single person we interviewed really disliked
          having to make decisions for a group of people since it tends to give anxiety. This proves that the solution that
          the app is designed to be for definitely has a use-case in everyday life. We created 4 personas that represent our
          user archetypes based on the notes that were most similar in topic on the miro board. We found that the factors
          that affected peoples’ decisions the most were how difficult it was to eat at a specific place, the price of the food,
          the cost of the food, and the timing of when they want to eat. All of our archetypes were similar in that they are
          people who want tasty food at a fair price, but when it comes to social eating, they want to have a way to do this
          easier as a group so that everyone can enjoy themselves as much as possible. The personas/archetypes are listed below.

            <p>She is a busy 24 year old Asian young professional that doesn't have a lot of time in between things
              to worry about food. She likes to plan what she's going to eat the next day but it still takes her a
              long time. She schedules when to hang out with people and wants to know where they will be eating beforehand.
              Even with all this, she still prefers not to be the final decision maker when it comes to where to eat with
              a group due to indecision and because money is less of a concern for her compared to her group of friends.
              She enjoys eating with the same 2 groups of people, her close friends and family members. She likes eating with
              people because it is a good way to socialize with her busy schedule and keeps her sane from all the work she's
              always doing. When going to a place she has already tried, she always wants to order something new so that she doesn't get bored.</p>

            <p>Jacob is a 19 year old Caucasian fast food employee who works at In-N-Out and his absolute favorite thing
              to eat is a double cheeseburger. He likes trying different foods but his palette is a bit restricted since
              he doesn't like foods that have too strong of flavors(garlic, onions, spices, etc.) so he tends to not like
              Asian cuisine as much as American and Mexican food. Jacob doesn't really like to plan where he wants to eat
              and only investigates where he's really hungry, but he absolutely needs to have meat at every meal. Eating
              is less about being social and more about making sure he isn't hungry, which is why he eats out up to 5
              times a week. Fast foods are some of his favorite choices since it is quick, affordable, and gets the job done.</p>
            <h2>Goals/Wishes</h2>

      <p>What worked well:</p>
        <li>User evaluation helped us a lot with making our design decisions.</li>
        <li>A user quiz is more time efficient than browsing a list of restaurants and deciding where to eat via conversation.</li>
        <li>The anonymous voting list was a feature that tested really well with users.</li>
        <br>
        Challenges:<br>
        <li>Figuring out how to differentiate from competitors in a meaningful way.</li>
